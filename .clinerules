CRITICAL: Follow this sequence for every project:

1. Check for prd.md → If missing, run /prd-builder
2. Phase 0: Pack Discovery → Run /pack-discovery to fetch skills from GitHub
3. Phase 1: Project Roadmap → Run /roadmap-generator
4. Phase 2+: Implementation → Execute per roadmap phases

Always read .agent/instructions.md before any work.
Skills from custom/third-party repos require /skill-preview before activation.
Maintain .agent/project-context.md as a living document throughout the project.
